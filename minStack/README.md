## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
inside `src`:
- minStack.java : the mimn stack data  structure.
- tests.java : contains two test cases that checks the data  structure.
- App.java: run two tests on MinStack.
